# Enhanced Save All

The "Enhanced Save All" extension makes it convenient for you to use scratch files (untitled files) such as QuokkaJS scratchpads or any temporary buffers that you don't intend on saving. No more popup save dialogs for those scratch files!

## Features

The "Save All except Untitled" will save all editors with changes, except the ones that are _untitled_ (new unsaved files).

The "Save All in Group except Untitled" command works in the same fashion, but on editors in the active tab group.


The extension provides default keybindings for those commands that do not override VSCode default keybinding for "Save All". You can however override those keybindings in order to make your workflow more seamless.
